Welcome to the **Flutter Clean Architecture Starter Kit**! This repository is designed to provide a solid foundation for your Flutter projects by implementing clean architecture principles, best practices, and modern development tools.

---

## Clean Architecture Overview

Clean Architecture is a software design philosophy that emphasizes the separation of concerns, creating highly maintainable, testable, and scalable applications.

Benefits of Clean Architecture:

- 💡 **Scalability**: Easily adapt your codebase to new features and requirements.
- 🧪 **Testability**: Simplify unit testing by isolating business logic from the UI and data sources.
- 🛠️ Maintainability: Modular design improves readability and reduces technical debt.
- 🔄 Reusability: Code can be reused across platforms and layers.

This starter kit follows the Clean Architecture pattern, ensuring your Flutter projects adhere to these principles from the start.

## Features

- 🏗️ **Layered Architecture:** Clear separation of `Presentation`, `Domain`, and `Data` layers.
- 🎯 **State Management:** Powered by `flutter_bloc` for robust and reactive state handling.
- 🛠️ **Dependency Injection:** Easy service locator setup using `GetIt`.
- 🌐 **Networking:** API integration made simple with `dio`.
- 💾 **Local Storage:** Manage lightweight data storage using `shared_preferences`.
- ⚡ **Error Handling:** Functional programming tools via `dartz` for safe and predictable error handling.
- 📶 **Connectivity:** Network checks using `data_connection_checker_tv`.

## Core Folder Structure

The `core` folder contains shared utilities and base classes that provide foundational functionality across your application:

### `error/`:
- Manages error and failure handling across all layers.
- Provides classes like `Failure` to standardize error representation.

### `network/`:
- Handles network-related concerns such as connectivity checks.
- Ensures reliable API interaction by checking connection status.

### `usecases/`:
- Contains base use case classes to define consistent business logic patterns.
- Simplifies interaction between domain and data layers.

### `utils/`:
- Houses helper functions, constants, and other reusable utilities.
- Provides tools to reduce code duplication and enhance maintainability.

### `injection_container.dart`:
- Configures and manages dependency injection using GetIt.
- Centralizes dependency registration for easy maintenance.

## Features Folder Structure

The `features` folder organizes your app's functionalities into independent modules. Each module contains its own `data`, `domain`, and `presentation` layers, ensuring modularity and scalability.

### `template/`:
- A ready-to-use template to quickly scaffold new features.
- Copy and rename the folder to match your feature name.

#### Subfolders in `template/`:

##### `data/`:
- Implements data sources, models, and repository logic.
- Connects to remote APIs or local databases.

##### `domain/`:
- Defines core business entities and use cases.
- Encapsulates application-specific business rules.

##### `presentation/`:
- Contains UI components like pages, widgets, and BLoC for state management.
- Ensures seamless integration with the user interface.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK**: Ensure you have Flutter installed. Follow the [official guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) if needed.
- **IDE**: Use any Flutter-supported IDE (VS Code, Android Studio, etc.).
- **Dart**: Version 3.0 or higher is recommended.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/resourceful-nebil/Flutter-Clean-Architecture-Starter-Kit-Template.git
   cd Flutter-Clean-Architecture-Starter-Kit-Template
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the App**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

---

## How to Use

### Adding Features

1. **Use the Template Folder**
   - Open **VS Code** and use the **Search and Replace** feature.
   - Search for the word `template` and replace it with the name of the feature you are implementing.
   - Copy the `template` feature folder as many times as you need for additional features.
   - Replace `template` in all copied folders with the respective feature name.

   This process will save you time by automating the creation of boilerplate code for your app's features, keeping your project consistent and clean.

2. **Define Entities** in `domain/entities/` to represent core business objects.
3. **Create Use Cases** in `domain/usecases/` to encapsulate application-specific business logic.
4. **Implement Repositories** in `data/repositories/` to handle data fetching and storage logic.
5. **Add Data Sources** in `data/datasources/` for remote (API) and local (cache) data handling.
6. **Integrate with UI** using `flutter_bloc` for state management and UI updates.

### Dependency Injection

Dependencies are managed with `GetIt`. Add your dependencies in `lib/core/injection_container.dart`:

```dart
final sl = GetIt.instance;

void init() {
  // Example: Register a repository
  sl.registerLazySingleton<YourRepository>(() => YourRepositoryImpl(sl()));
}
```

## Example

Here’s a quick walkthrough for adding a feature:

### Feature: Fetch User Profile

1. **Entity**
   ```dart
   class UserProfile {
     final String id;
     final String name;
     final String email;

     UserProfile({required this.id, required this.name, required this.email});
   }
   ```

2. **Use Case**
   ```dart
   class GetUserProfile {
     final UserRepository repository;

     GetUserProfile(this.repository);

     Future<Either<Failure, UserProfile>> call(String userId) {
       return repository.getUserProfile(userId);
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Repository Contract**
   ```dart
   abstract class UserRepository {
     Future<Either<Failure, UserProfile>> getUserProfile(String userId);
   }
   ```

4. **Repository Implementation**
   ```dart
   class UserRepositoryImpl implements UserRepository {
     final RemoteDataSource remoteDataSource;

     UserRepositoryImpl(this.remoteDataSource);

     @override
     Future<Either<Failure, UserProfile>> getUserProfile(String userId) async {
       try {
         final result = await remoteDataSource.fetchUserProfile(userId);
         return Right(result);
       } catch (e) {
         return Left(ServerFailure());
       }
     }
   }
   ```

5. **Remote Data Source**
   ```dart
   class RemoteDataSource {
     final Dio dio;

     RemoteDataSource(this.dio);

     Future<UserProfile> fetchUserProfile(String userId) async {
       final response = await dio.get('/users/$userId');
       return UserProfile(
         id: response.data['id'],
         name: response.data['name'],
         email: response.data['email'],
       );
     }
   }
   ```
